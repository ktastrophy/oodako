# Oodako

*What*
Oodako is a manager for inkscape's interactive mode, the open source vector image editor.

*Why*
I needed a fast, reliable (read: server side), way to convert SVG into other formats. Inkscape provided the reliable part but not so much the speed even when run in headless mode due to the fact the the process is very slow to start. However, inkscape does have an interactive mode that allows the application to keep running and to process additional commands. This is where Oodako comes in.

*How to use*
See awful commented out test case at the bottom of the script... sorry.

*Why the name?*
Oodako (lit. Large Octopus) is the name of the large octopus from King King vs. Godzilla. So... inkscape -> ink -> octopus -> octopus from Godzilla (I'm a fan)
